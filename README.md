## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**mlucas-csu/mlucas-csu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Master's program in AI/ML and I'm refreshing and continuing to develop my programming skills as the first part of the program.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about python and focusing on that language for s/w dev work

- âš¡ Fun fact: I have wide-ranging interests; in addition to engineering and programming, I love reading, hiking, skiing, and brazilian jiu-jitsu!
